# Stock Average Price Calculator 📈💸

## About 🌍

The **Stock Average Price Calculator** is a mobile application built using **Flutter** and developed through **Prompt Engineering**. It is designed to help users track their stock investments efficiently. Here's how the app works:

- **Track Stock Investments**: The app allows users to manage their stock portfolio.
- **Input Stock Data**: Users can enter the **Quantity** and **Price Per Unit** for each stock purchase.
- **Automatic Calculation**:
  - The app calculates the **Total Investment** for each purchase.
  - It also computes the **Overall Average Price** across all the stock purchases.
- **Manage Entries**: Users can add multiple stock entries, delete them using the **Dustbin (Trash Can) Icon**, or reset all calculations while preserving the history of previous investments.
- **Timestamp for Entries**: Each stock entry includes a **Timestamp** when the entry is added, allowing users to track when each stock purchase occurred.

This app was created using **Prompt Engineering** to leverage the power of AI tools and generate code with clear, specific instructions, making the development process faster and more efficient.

## Features ✨

- **Add Stock Entries**: 📝 Input quantity and price per unit for each stock purchase. The app calculates the total investment for each entry and updates the overall average.
- **Delete Entries**: 🗑️ Use the **Dustbin (Trash Can)** icon next to any entry to remove it from the list.
- **Reset Calculations**: 🔄 Reset all entries and calculations, but keep your historical data in the app's history section.
- **Calculation History**: 📜 View the history of all added stock entries, including:
  - **Quantity**
  - **Price per unit**
  - **Total Investment**
  - **Timestamp** (when the entry was added)
- **Theme Customization**: 🌗 Switch between **Light**, **Dark**, or **System Default** themes for a personalized app experience.
- **Social Links**: 🔗 Quick access to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinmay-nerkar/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Chinmaynkr) profiles from the app drawer.
- **Overall Average Calculation**: 💹 The app displays the total invested amount and the average price across all purchases.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Adding Entries**: 
   - Enter the **Quantity** and **Price Per Unit** of the stock.
   - When you click the **Add Entry** button, the app calculates the **Total Investment** for that entry.
   - The app also records a **Timestamp** for when the entry is added.
   - The **Overall Average Price** is updated with each new entry.

2. **Deleting Entries**:
   - Tap the **Dustbin (Trash Can) Icon** next to any entry to remove it.
   - Deleting an entry will automatically update the overall average price and remove its timestamp.

3. **Resetting Calculations**:
   - Press the **Reset** button to clear all entries.
   - The reset clears the displayed total investment and overall average, but the historical data, including timestamps, is preserved in the app's history section.

4. **Viewing History**:
   - The **History** section in the app's drawer displays all past stock entries.
   - The history includes **Quantity**, **Price Per Unit**, **Total Investment**, and the **Timestamp** for each entry.

5. **Theme Switching**:
   - From the app drawer, users can toggle between **Light**, **Dark**, or **System Default** themes.

6. **Accessing Social Links**:
   - The app drawer includes links to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com) profiles. Feel free to connect! 🌍
